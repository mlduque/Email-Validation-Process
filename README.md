# Email-Validation-Process
With this program/code, you will be able to validate lists of email addresses directly from a .csv file.

## Usage
The program reads the email addresses from a .csv file named "email_input.csv" using the csv.reader module. Each email address in the .csv file should be in a separate row.
Ensure that you have a file named "email_input.csv" in the same directory as your Python script and populate it with the email addresses you want to validate, each on a separate row.
After running the program, it will validate the email addresses and save the results to a new .csv file named "email_list.csv" in the same directory.

- Make sure you have the dnspython library installed ``` pip install dnspython ``` to use the updated dns.resolver module.
- Open your terminal cdm and run ```python validate.py``` in the same directory as your Python script and yoyr file named "email_input.csv" are. After runing the progam, a new .csv file named "email_list.csv" will be created in the same directory saved with the results of the validation.
